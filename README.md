Shoe Store System – “Zapatería Fanny”

Description
-----------
This project is a console-based interactive application developed in C for a fictional shoe store called "Zapatería Fanny". The system simulates a basic menu-driven interface that allows the user to explore different categories of shoes, including casual shoes, high heels, and sneakers. The user can choose attributes such as color, size, material, model, and price, as well as leave comments.

This program was created as part of an introductory programming exam for structured programming using C on Windows.

Features
--------
- Secure entry with a NIP code (default: 123)
- Main menu with options:
  - Casual Shoes
  - High Heel Shoes
  - Sneakers
  - Exit System
- Submenus for each category:
  - Color selection
  - Size selection
  - Material type
  - Model options
  - Price list
  - Observations/comments section
- Repeated access to features based on user input
- Visual enhancement using Windows console commands (e.g., color and screen clearing)

Requirements
------------
- Operating System: Windows
- Compiler: MinGW, Code::Blocks, or any C-compatible compiler for Windows
- Language support: Spanish locale
- Libraries used:
  - stdio.h
  - stdlib.h
  - locale.h
  - windows.h

How to Run
----------
1. Open the source file (main.c) in your preferred C IDE or text editor.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler compatible with Windows.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Enter the NIP when prompted (use 123).
5. Navigate through the menus to explore different shoe options.

Notes
-----
- This is a basic educational system and does not store or process real sales or inventory data.
- Most options reset after selection and return the user to the menu.
- Observations/comments are received but not saved to a file.
- The interface uses basic console outputs and system commands for UI flow.
